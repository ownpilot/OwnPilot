## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Autonomous Subagent System** — Chat agents and background agents can spawn lightweight child agents for parallel task execution with fire-and-forget spawning, budget enforcement (concurrent limits, total spawn limits, nesting depth cap), and independent model selection per subagent
- **5 Subagent LLM Tools** — `spawn_subagent`, `check_subagent`, `get_subagent_result`, `cancel_subagent`, `list_subagents` for full lifecycle control from within agent conversations
- **Subagent REST API** — `/api/v1/subagents` endpoints for spawn, list, get, cancel, and execution history
- **Subagent WebSocket Events** — Real-time `subagent:spawned`, `subagent:progress`, `subagent:completed` events for UI updates
- **Subagent DB Persistence** — `subagent_history` table for audit trail of completed executions
- **Subagent Model Routing** — Per-process model routing now supports `subagent` process type alongside chat, channel, and pulse

### Testing

- 389+ test files, 22,100+ tests total (91 new subagent tests across 6 files)

## [0.1.4] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Background Agents** — Persistent autonomous agents that run independently on interval, continuous, or event-driven schedules with rate limiting, budget tracking, auto-pause on errors, and graceful shutdown
- **Background Agent Full Tool Access** — Background agents now have the same capabilities as chat agents: all 170+ tools, extension/skill tools, plugin tools, MCP tools, memory injection, and configurable provider/model selection
- **Background Agent Workspace Isolation** — Each background agent gets an isolated file workspace for safe file operations
- **WhatsApp Baileys Integration** — Replaced Meta Cloud API with Baileys library for WhatsApp; QR code authentication (no Meta Business account needed), self-chat mode with loop prevention, session persistence in app data directory
- **Channel User Approval System** — Multi-step verification for channel users: approval code flow, manual admin approval, user blocking/unblocking with real-time notifications
- **EventBus Deep Integration** — Unified event backbone across the entire system; EventBusBridge translates dot-notation events to WebSocket colon-notation for real-time UI updates
- **Event Monitor UI** — Live event stream viewer for debugging EventBus events in the web UI
- **Extension SDK** — Extensions can call any of 150+ built-in tools via `utils.callTool()`, with `utils.listTools()`, Config Center access, and blocked tool enforcement
- **6 Default Extensions** — Daily Briefing, Knowledge Base, Project Tracker, Smart Search, Automation Builder, Contact Enricher bundled out-of-the-box
- **Extension Security Audit** — LLM-powered security analysis for skills and extensions before installation
- **Selective Extension Injection** — Request-preprocessor routing for targeted extension injection per conversation
- **Channel Soft Disconnect / Hard Logout** — `disconnect()` preserves session for instant reconnect; `logout()` clears session data requiring re-authentication (e.g. new QR scan)
- **Workflow Enhancements** — 7 new node types, input_schema column, workflow versioning and approvals

### Changed

- Extension tools synced into shared ToolRegistry with `ext.*`/`skill.*` namespace prefixes
- Channel user events (`first_seen`, `blocked`, `unblocked`, `pending`) emitted via EventBus with complete WS forwarding
- Channels reduced to Telegram + WhatsApp (Discord/Slack/LINE/Matrix removed)

### Fixed

- **Scheduler Day Boundary** — `getNextRunTime` test failed on month-end dates (e.g. Feb 28 → Mar 1) due to incorrect rollover arithmetic
- **Vitest Constructor Mocks** — Fixed test stability issues with constructor mocking patterns across gateway tests
- **Test Helpers Build Error** — Added explicit return types to test-helpers to fix TS2742 build error

### Testing

- 366+ test files, 21,500+ tests total
- New: background-agent-manager, background-agent-runner, background-agent-tools, service-impl logout tests

## [0.1.3] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **Model Routing** — Per-process model selection (chat, telegram, pulse) with provider fallback chains, configurable via API and UI
- **Extended Thinking** — Anthropic extended thinking support with configurable budget tokens for deeper reasoning
- **Sidebar Reorganization** — Navigation menus reordered by usage frequency: daily items at top, power-user features in collapsible groups, settings ordered by domain

### Fixed

- **Telegram FK Constraint** — Second message after server restart failed with `channel_sessions_conversation_id_fkey` violation; conversation recovery now persists to DB before updating FK (fixes #7)
- **Dashboard Streaming** — Null model parameter caused TypeScript build failures in `generateAIBriefingStreaming`
- **Expenses Page** — Feb-31 date bug when filtering by month; added edit support with modal form
- **SystemPage Polling** — Database operation status polling leaked timers on unmount; added ref-based cleanup
- **ApiKeysPage** — Default model save silently swallowed errors; now shows toast feedback
- **AutonomyPage** — `Promise.all` → `Promise.allSettled` so partial API failures don't blank the page
- **ModelsPage** — Settings link pointed to `/settings` instead of `/settings/api-keys`
- **WorkspacesPage** — Empty workspace badge showed for workspaces with 1 file (should be 0)
- **CalendarPage** — No validation when end date/time was before start
- **TasksPage** — Missing `cancelled` status in filter and visual styling
- **SKILL.md Parser** — Improved YAML metadata parsing for block sequences and nested maps

### Changed

- Config Center: removed 5 orphaned seed services (Deepgram, DeepL, Tavily, Serper, Perplexity) with no built-in consumer code
- Gateway routes: `parseJsonBody` helper adopted across all route modules
- Dev dependencies bumped: ESLint 10.0.2, Turbo 2.8.11, typescript-eslint 8.56.1
- `.gitignore`: broader protection patterns for stray generated files

## [0.1.2] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **CLI Tools Platform** — 40+ discoverable CLI tools with automatic PATH-based binary detection, categorization (linters, formatters, build tools, package managers, security scanners, databases, containers), and version detection

- **Custom CLI Tool Registration** — Register any binary as a CLI tool with category and risk metadata via `POST /cli-tools/custom`
- **CLI Policy Approval Integration** — Per-tool policies wired into the real-time approval flow in the orchestrator, dynamic risk scoring based on catalog risk levels
- **Coding Agents** — Orchestrate external AI coding CLIs (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI) with session management, real-time terminal output streaming, and result persistence
- **Dual Execution Modes** — Auto mode (headless `child_process.spawn`) and interactive mode (PTY terminal) for coding agents
- **Custom Coding Agent Providers** — Register any CLI binary as a coding agent provider via the CLI Providers API
- **Model Routing** — Per-process model selection (chat, telegram, pulse) with fallback chains, configurable via API and UI

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-23

### Added
